# String Puzzles
#### Respond to the following:

1. *In your own words*, discuss what each String method does:
  * `.substring(a)`
    It will take everything after and including a. So if a was 3, it would take the 3rd position and everything else.

  * `.substring(a, b)`
    It will take everything from point a to point b but not including b.

  * `.indexOf(str)`
    It will find the position / index of a certain letter or word.

  * `.equals(str)`
    To compare the values of 2 strings.


2. *In your own words*, discuss what the following `for` loop accomplishes for `String s`:
```
for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
      // DO STUFF
}
```
 This for loop, takes the length of s and repeates the code it contains below until i is no longer less than the length of s.
